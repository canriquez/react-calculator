- This project is far from perfect. I decided to practice some basic ideas about accesibility by usig full controll via keyboard / mouse.
- This project is also a practice implementation for the AWS service [Amazon Polly](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/)


## How to use it.

### Normal operation

- You can use the calculator by clicking on the buttons or touch screen device as a normal calculator.
- You can key the numbers and operations using the keyboard.

### Activate Text to Speech functionality:
- Touck/Click: Speech function is activated clicking/touching the button `Speech`. 
- Keyboard: Typing the key 's'. 
- On activation you will hear a voice with an activation message en english (default language).
- A Icon  ![](./src/assets/icons/speech.svg) will appear on display to indicate the Text to Speech activation. 

### Change text to speech language 
- Touch/Click: on buttons `En` or `Sp` for language toggling.
- On Toggling you will here a voice on the selected language. The proper Icons will appear on Display.
